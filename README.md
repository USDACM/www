Hello USD ACM!  This is our website.  If you would like to contribute to development, please go ahead and feel free.  

We are currently looking for someone/someones to be the designated "maintainer" for the site.  Basically, this means you would review the changes people submit, make sure they work, and ensure changes conform to the overall design you have going for the website.  

If you are interested, contact ottocode!

The current website depends on the bootstrap library which we have forked as a seperate USDACM repository.  If you want to become the maintainer and you decide that another library is the way to go, then feel free!  (Or if you want to set up a better way to include the bootstrap library, that would be awesome).
