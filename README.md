Hello USD ACM!  This is our website.  If you would like to contribute to development, please go ahead and feel free.  

We are currently looking for someone/someones to be the designated "maintainer" for the site.  Basically, this means you would review the changes people submit, make sure they work, and ensure changes conform to the overall design you have going for the website.  

If you are interested, contact ottocode!

After playing with a number of things, I've switched to using the foundation framework.  Foundation seems to be a little more straightforward and has, in my opinion, simpler documentation.

TODO list:
create the events, projects, tutoring pages.
add a signup for updates
add links to our github and usd torrero link pages.
