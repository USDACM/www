Q&A allows any WordPress site to have a fully featured questions and answers section - just like StackOverflow, Yahoo Answers, Quora and more...except better :)

You've seen how engaging, informative, and just plain fun Q&A sites such as Quora can be.

With this plugin, you can bring full Questions and Answers functionality to any WordPress or BuddyPress site in mere minutes!

Chock-full of features such as:

* Full **front-end** capability - users don't ever have to see your site's admin back-end
* **WYSIWYG** editing of both questions and answers
* Snazzy **voting** for both questions and answers
* Integrated **reputation points** system
* Dedicated **user profile** pages
* Easy theme integration using **widgets**
* Fully **customizable** using dedicated template files

This extensive and powerful plugin covers all the question and answer bases right out of the box while easily installed and fully operational in moments -- and highly customizable too!

= Styling =

Copy the php files from default-templates into your theme folder and start customizing.

To disable the default CSS, add the following line to your theme's functions.php file:

`add_theme_support( 'qa_style' );`

To disable the default JavaScript, add the following line to your theme's functions.php file:

`add_theme_support( 'qa_script' );`

When you feel the Q&A section is ready for prime time, if your theme supports [custom menus](http://en.support.wordpress.com/menus/), you could add direct links to http://yoursite.com/questions/ and even to http://yoursite.com/questions/ask/ to your main menu.
